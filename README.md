__About the EITCA Academy:__

The European Information Technologies Certification Academy enables access to the European IT Certification standard for digital skills and IT competencies attestation. It is available online from Brussels, EU under a governance of the European Information Technologies Certification Institute (EITCI), a not-for-profit accreditation and certification authority for the programme that develops and disseminates it internationally.

In terms of curricula advancement, the EITCA Academy - as an international IT competencies certification framework can be treated as a postgraduate program. It is less theoretical in its aproach than the academic programmes credentials and more practice oriented in order to be aligned with professional career development. While the European IT Certificaiton framework attests a similar degree of skills comprehensiveness as more formal academic programmes, it holds certain advantages, as more practically oriented, flexible and conducted fully online. 
Both EITCA and EITC Certifications constitute an important confirmation of the holder's relevant IT expertise & skills, empowering individuals worldwide by certifying their competencies and supporting their careers. 

__About the "Information Technologies Security Certification of the European IT Certification Academy (EITCA/IS) Program:__ 

EITCA/IS Information Security Academy certificate is an official EU based, internationally recognized attestation of competence, systematizing theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the field of information security.  It attests individuals as experts in state-of-the-art Cybersecurity, with professional competencies in computational complexity, classical cryptography (including both private-key symmetric cryptography and public-key asymmetric cryptography), quantum cryptography (with emphasis on QKD, quantum key distribution), quantum information and quantum computation introduction (including notion of quantum circuits, quantum gates and quantum algorithmics with emphasis on practical algorithms such as Shor factorization or discrete log finding algorithms), secure computer networking (including theoretical OSI model), computer systems security (covering fundamentals and advanced practical topics, including mobile devices security), network servers administration (including Microsoft Windows and Linux), web applications security and web application penetration testing (including several practical pentesting techniques).

The EITCA/IS Information Security Academy programme includes 12 single EITC certificates (European Information Technologies Certification courses) with a total of 180 hours of didactic content (15 hours for each EITC certificate).
